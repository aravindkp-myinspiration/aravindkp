<h2 align="left"><font face="Matura MT Script Capitals" color="white"><b>Aravind KP was born on 8 December 1985 in Udupi, Karnataka. He also got his childhood education from Udupi. During his schooling, he used to ride his fathers scooter. Seeing his fondness for scooter bikes, his father told Aravind that he would gift him a bike when he passed his intermediate exam with 84 percent.
Hearing Papas voice, Aravind study very well and passed his 12th examination with 84% marks. After passing the intermediate, his father gifted a Yamaha RX 135 cc bike to Aravind which was the first bike of his life. He used to play games like pole vault, track, and field, skating, shuttle badminton during his school days.
After that, when he went to college after completing his schooling, he was seen the Kambla racing game in Manipur and got very much inspired by the game, and it was from here that his interest started moving towards racing.

When he was 16 years old, he had seen TVS racing of 50cc moped bikes, then he did not know that racing would be his career and in that he would make his future. But when he was 19 years old, he started participating in local events racing during his college days without telling his parents, during which his friends helped Aravind a lot.

During his college days, when Aravind's bike got some problems, then his friends would help them to fix his bike, a clutch cable would be corrected, or when he had no money, a friend would give him money too, Even Aravind's friends fed him food. When he once went home after winning a local event racing, then his photo was printed in a newspaper.

Seeing the photo of his son in the newspaper as a bike racer, his father was very upset and he said why are you doing this monkey act in college. Then Aravind had somehow converted his parents towards his racing and also convinced them. In 2005, at the age of 19, Aravind started national-level professional motorcycle racing.</b></font></h2>

<h2 align="left"><b><font color="yellow" face="Lucida Calligraphy">In 2006, he participated in the Gulf Directorate National Championship organized by TVS Racing and was also a winner there. Aravind then won the National Championship title more than 17 times in dirt tracks, rallies, and motor crosses. Apart from this, he also participated in the MRF Supercross National Championship in 2009.

In 2011, he participated in the Motorcraft Championship organized by Sri Lanka Motor Race Drivers Association, and by winning this championship he became the first Indian to win the Overseas Motorcross Championship. He also suffered a number of injuries during the Motor Champion Pressing in Sri Lanka, which took him months and years to recover.

Due to this hard work and deriding passion, Aravind has to suffer from injuries and has to prepare himself for the race again and every time. He has been the winner of the National Super Cross Championship at Kolhapur, Coimbatore in 2013, and the Ultimate Bike Division Championship at the Southern Dare Rally.

He has won off-road Indian races in 2015 like Maruti Suzuki South Dare (2000 km), MRF Super Cross (seven rounds), and Maruti Suzuki Red De Himalaya (2500 km). In 2016, Aravind participated in the Olivia rally which took place in Morocco where he finished at 25th place.

In 2016, Aravind became the second Indian to complete the Dakar rally held in Peru where he finished in 39th place. Before him, this feat was completed by C.S. Santosh in 2015, in which he finished in 36th place.

The Dakar rally is considered to be one of the toughest rallies in the world, for which Aravind worked hard for years, and did strict workouts like cycling, swimming, gyming. He also suffered a lot of injuries during this rally which took years to recover.</b></font><h2>
